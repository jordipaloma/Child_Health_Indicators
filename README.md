# Child Health Indicators - Linear Regression using Neural Networks (Keras)

Predict child mortality rate (between ages 1 and 5) depending on the water and sanitation conditions from current and past years.

Improved drinking water sources include “at least basic services”, which refers to households using an improved water source with water collection times of no more than 30 minutes per round trip.

Access to “at least basic sanitation” includes the population using improved sanitation methods that are not shared.

The idea of predicting child mortality rate based on water and sanitation factors is useful to evaluate what should be improved in developing countries to decrease child mortality.
